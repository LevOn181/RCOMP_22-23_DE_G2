### RCOMP - SPRINT 4 - REVIEW #

# Sprint Master: Monika Zemankiewicz - 1220451

1. Necessary decisions were taken during a group meeting and saved in the planning.md file - we decided on Java as our implementation language. 

2. All required features were implemented during the sprint.

3. We cooperated using Discord and bitbucket for version control. 

4. After development of the client and server applications we tested the code. Some bugs were found but we managed to fix them.
