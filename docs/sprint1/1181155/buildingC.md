## Justifications <a name="justifications"></a>\
\
\
>### Cables <a name="cable"></a>\
\
The cables were layed out on the schematic plan in a way that maximizes common pathways and achieves lower cable lengths.\
\
Maximizing common pathways reduces the complexity of the scheme, it is important in order to facilitate the installation of the cables and future repairs or \
upgrades.\
\
Minimizing cable lengths is crucial in order to reduce overall costs.\
\
In the first floor the cables travel through the underfloor cable raceway.\
\
On the second floor the cables travel in the space above the dropped ceiling.\
\
### Copper Cables ####\
\
- CAT 7 copper cables are used between each outlet and each floor's horizontal cross-connect.\
\
- CAT 7 copper cables allow for higher data rates, up to 10Gbps.\
\
- T568-A copper cable wiring.\
\
- Each copper cable connecting an outlet to a horizontal cross-connect or a consolidation point is less than 90 meters \
long.\
\
### Optical Fibre Cables ####\
- Multimode optical fibre used for the backbones cabling since the distance between the ICs and the HCs are under 1000 \
meters.\
\
- There 6 fibre cables, 2 for each traject (Outside to IC, IC to ground floor HC, IC to first floor HC)\
- Each optical fibre cable has 12 fibres allowing for 6 parallel full-duplex data links.\
\
- This is to provide a safety margin over the recommended minimum of 8 fibre - 4 paralell full-duplex data links.\
\
- Each fibre cable inside the building is less than 90 meters long\
\
###Patch cords\
\
- The design expects 190 patch cords that are 5 meters long each, one for each outlet.\
\
>###Network Outlets\
\
The design follows the standard of a minimum of 2 outlets per work area and 2 outlets for each 10 square meters of area.\
\
There are in total 190 network outlets, 88 in the first floor and 102 in the second floor\
\
The outlets are strategically positioned in a way that the user can find an outlet less than 3 meters away from any\
point in a room.\
\
>### Patch Panels\
\
### Copper patch panels\
\
The plan accounts for 9 copper patch panels, 4 in the ground floor and 5 in the first floor\
\
The patch panels used are 1U - 24 connectors patch panels.\
\
In the ground floor, the patch panels will be housed in the telecommunications enclosure (TE) of the storage room \
(room D.0.15). In the first floor the patch panels will be housed in the TE of the room D.1.8 (storage room).\
\
4 patch panels are used in the ground floor in order to accomodate the 88 outlets, 2 access points of the first floor,\
along with the required connection between patch panels and the connection to the internet.\
\
5 patch panels are used in the first floor in order to accomodate the 102 outlets, 2 access points of the first floor,\
along with the required connection between patch panels and the connection to the internet.\
\
###Fibre patch panels\
\
The plan accounts for 3 fibre patch panels, one for each cross connect. Therefore 2 in the ground floor where the IC and\
the ground floor HC are located and 1 in the first floor where the first floor HC is located. \
\
>###Access Points (APs)\
\
Four access points will be used, 2 at each floor. \
\
Although using only one access point provides enough coverage for an entire floor, 2 are used in each floor for redundancy and \
also to lower the number of users connected to a single AP thus providing better performance.\
\
Each AP is located closer to the rooms that we expect a higher concentration of users.\
\
> ###Cross-connects and telecommunication enclosures\
\
There are 4 cross-connects in total, one IC for the building and one HC for each floor\
\
The scheme accounts for an HC in each floor for 3 reasons:\
\
- First reason is because a single HC should not cover an area larger than 900 m<sup>2</sup>\
\
\
- Second reason being that a telecommunications enclosure where an HC is housed should not have more than 200 cables \
entering in.\
\
\
- Third reason being the size constraints imposed by a standard 19'' rack format telecommunication enclosure.\
\
###Ground floor\
\
The room D.0.15 houses a standard 19'' rack format telecommunications enclosure which is 42U tall.\
\
This telecommunication enclosure in turn houses the IC and the ground floor HC. This TE will hold 4 copper patch panels\
and 2 fibre patch panels, together they will occupy 6U of vertical space.\
\
This is within the limits of 6 times the U units occupied by the patch panels (6*6 = 36), allowing space for the active \
equipments, the UPSs and future upgrades/expansions.\
\
Rule used: units space required for the patch panels is (S), (6 x S) U units size for the enclosure.\
<br></br>\
###First floor\
\
The room D.1.8 houses a standard 19'' rack format telecommunications enclosure which is 42U tall.\
\
This telecommunication enclosure in turn houses the ground floor HC. This TE will hold 5 copper patch panels\
and 1 fibre patch panel, together they will occupy 6U of vertical space.\
\
This is within the limits of 6 times the U units occupied by the patch panels (6*6 = 36), allowing space for the active\
equipments, the UPSs and future upgrades/expansions.\
\
Rule used: units space required for the patch panels is (S), (6 x S) U units size for the enclosure.\
